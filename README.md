----------------------------------------------------------

This repository has my portfolio code which i have written for Udacity Front End Nanodegree program.

My Approach

- In this i tried to create a responsive web page for my porfolio
- I tried to use grid layout insted of using any buildin framwork like bootstrap
- To make page load fast, i used secset attribute of img tag which will load the appropriate image.
- To achieve styling, used css.
